Letter to Mother


Dear Mom,

I hope things are going well, I miss you and the rest of the family. I'm doing a thing for that class I'm teaching and in the interest of saving time I'm going to have to fake the rest of this letter. Please don't take it personaly. You know I love you.

Phasellus vel libero sit amet turpis elementum egestas. Phasellus vitae faucibus lorem. Quisque euismod orci at felis rutrum venenatis. I really mean it. Give my love to Dad.

Your son,

Nathan
